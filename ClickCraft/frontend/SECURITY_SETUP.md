# Appwrite Security Setup Guide

## Current Issue
Appwrite is showing a security warning: "Appwrite is using localStorage for session management. Increase your security by adding a custom domain as your API endpoint."

## Solutions

### 1. Create Environment Variables File

Create a `.env` file in your frontend directory with the following content:

```env
# Appwrite Configuration
# Option 1: Use custom domain (RECOMMENDED for production)
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-custom-domain.com/v1

# Option 2: Use default Appwrite endpoint (less secure, for development)
# VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1

# Your Appwrite Project ID
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id

# Backend URL (if you have a separate backend)
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Set Up Custom Domain (Production)

To use a custom domain for better security:

1. **Get a domain**: Purchase a domain or use a subdomain
2. **Configure DNS**: Point your domain to Appwrite's servers
3. **Update Appwrite Console**: 
   - Go to your Appwrite console
   - Navigate to Settings > Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow the verification process
4. **Update Environment Variables**: Use your custom domain in the `.env` file

### 3. Alternative: Use Appwrite's Secure Endpoint

If you can't set up a custom domain, you can use Appwrite's more secure endpoint:

```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```

### 4. Session Security Best Practices

The current implementation already follows these best practices:

- ✅ **No localStorage for sensitive data**: We're not storing tokens in localStorage
- ✅ **Server-side session management**: Appwrite handles sessions securely
- ✅ **Automatic session cleanup**: Sessions are properly deleted on logout
- ✅ **HTTPS only**: All communication is encrypted

### 5. Additional Security Measures

Consider implementing:

- **Session timeout**: Configure automatic session expiration
- **Rate limiting**: Implement login attempt limits
- **2FA**: Add two-factor authentication
- **CORS configuration**: Properly configure CORS in Appwrite

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: ReferenceError in login function
✅ **Implemented**: Proper error handling in authentication
✅ **Secure**: No sensitive data in localStorage
⚠️ **Warning**: Using default Appwrite endpoint (consider custom domain for production)

## Next Steps

1. Create `.env` file with your actual Appwrite project ID
2. For production: Set up custom domain
3. Test authentication flow
4. Monitor for any remaining security warnings
